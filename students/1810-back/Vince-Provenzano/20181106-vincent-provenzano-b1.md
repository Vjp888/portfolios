# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  I wanted to see if I was actually capable of learning programming.
  I can safely say that I can code and actually understand what I am doing which is extremely exciting.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  I think I struggled most at the beginning, primarily with wrapping my head around the general logic of programming.
  I learned that once I understood the logic of code I could follow code and in turn write it with with an understanding that at least in my mind made sense.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite project would be a tie between Black Thursday and the Enigma Machine. These both felt like something that I could see coding in a job and really cemented what I was learning into actual skills.
  My least favorite would likely be Battleship primarily because it felt like it came a little too early. However I did learn quite a bit from the project so I can not say that it is truly at the bottom of my list.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  The first project, Sorting Cards, was a sort of wake up call. It taught me the importance of time management and just how much I needed to learn.

  The Enigma Machine was something of proof to myself that I actually do understand coding enough to create a functioning program. That I could logically breakdown how something works in the real world and implement it into lines of code.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I learned just how important general management and organization is when working in groups.
  With black Thursday my team made use of Waffle.io which streamlined our working process heavily and ensured we weren't accidentally stepping on each other toes. The progress was steady and the check-in were excellent for making sure we didn't leave someone behind or forget a key part of the project.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  I will admit that I did not contribute as much as I would have liked. I feel I contributed well to my mod. This mod I was focused on my own skills and learning as much as I can. Now that I have a better idea of what my time at Turing will be like I am more prepared to be more active in the community.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I would like to help at the try coding weekends, wether as a speaker or general aid. I also want to take part in more of the social events and intend to attend the different aid meetings (imposters and other additions).
